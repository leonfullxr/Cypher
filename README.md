## Architecture Description
1. Client Side

   1. User Interface (UI): Allows users to send/receive messages and manage contacts.
   2. Local Key Management: Generates and stores private keys encrypted with the master password.
   3. Encryption Module: Encrypts outgoing messages using the recipient's public key and decrypts incoming messages with the user's private key.
   4. TLS Layer: Ensures transport security between client and server.

2. Server Side

   1. Authentication Module:
      1. Handles user login with master password.
      2. Validates identity and grants access to stored data.
   2. Public Key Store: Stores users' public keys securely.
   3. Message Queue: Temporarily stores encrypted messages until they are retrieved by the recipient.
   4. Key Exchange Service: Implements Signal Protocol for secure session key negotiation.
   5. Database: Stores:
      1. Public keys.
      2. Encrypted messages (encrypted with recipientâ€™s public key).
      3. Encrypted private keys (encrypted with master passwords).

3. Database
   1. Encrypted storage using AES encryption for all data at rest.
   2. Strict access control policies.

4. Communication Protocol
   1. TLS: Protects communication between the client and server.
   2. Signal Protocol: Provides session key exchange and ensures forward secrecy.
